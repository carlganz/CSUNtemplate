# The First Chapter

## The First Section

We are writing this using LaTeX [@latex].

R Markdown is a much simpler language that compiles to LaTeX. We can do all sorts of things without the hassle of LaTeX:

*italics* and **bold**.

* A thing

* Another thing
  + Another another thing

1. First Thing

2. Second thing

# The Second Chapter

## The First Section in the Second Chapter

We can include raw LaTeX:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i} \leq \infty $$

We can also include inline LaTeX like so: $e^{i \pi}=-1$

We can also add code from various programming languages.

#### R

```{R}
x <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)
2+2
plot(x)
```

#### Haskell

```{haskell, engine.path='ghc'}
[x | x <- [1..10], odd x]
```

#### Python

```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```
