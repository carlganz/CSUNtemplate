# The First Chapter

## The First Section

We are writing this using LaTeX <!--[@latex]-->.

# The Second Chapter

## The First Section in the Second Chapter

We can include raw LaTeX:

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i} \leq \infty $$

We can also include inline LaTeX like so: $e^{i \pi}=-1$

We can also add code from various programming languages:

```{R, echo=FALSE}
x <- rnorm(10, 0, 1)
plot(x)
```
